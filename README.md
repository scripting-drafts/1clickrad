Tool to automate mildly random clicks

This script depends on the PyMouse module.

Get the coordinates where you want to click first. E.g. You can use MouseTools on OS X.

Then write each of them on X and Y as a range to pick 'random' coordinates for each click.

You can randomize the time interval between clicks too modifying the Z's.

Change the total number of clicks by changing the 't = VALUE'. Or use the previous 't' and input a range to randomize this variable.
